# Hattusa

Hattusa is a multi-format book reader.
You will be able to read soon, PDF/EPUB/MOBI/CBZ/CBR and more.

You can also run it from a web server so that anyone can read the books served from there. Or you can run it as a desktop web application for any platform, from Windows, Linux, MacOS and systems like Rasberry-PI, as long as you run a python interpreter.

At the moment it is not open to the contribution of other developers, since the main structure is not defined. Later on, there will be rules and contributions will be allowed.
